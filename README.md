# pgp-encrypt-browser
Encrypt/store data on server, and decrypt in browser with private key via Mailvelope API.

The idea of this example project is to facilitate properly encrypted online services using public-private key encryption models in the browser. 

See pgp-encrypt-browser.php for the implemetation. 

For deployment, 
1. Setup a server to serve the PHP file
2. Setup Mailvelope in your browser
3. Replace the public key in the PHP script with yours
4. Load the file in the browser and see the encrypted strings if you have the right private key. 

Ports to other programming languages are welcome.
